# Nuxt Kick Start

```ts
const await
```

Nuxt Content component module for generative AI

## Content

The content-driven site comes from [nuxt-kick-start](https://github.com/deniskropp/nuxt-kick-start) repository.
The module will be available seperately before our first release.

## Backend

In the background it runs on [KickServe](https://github.com/deniskropp/KickServe) API server.
The repository is private at the moment, but will be made public soon.
The server provides end-points for AI text generation as well as means to manage messages (sessions), a graph database, prompt templates and other things.
