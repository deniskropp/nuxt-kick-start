## Techniques

### Prompting

The Nuxt Kick Start module provides a variety of prompting options for generative AI. These options allow you to fine-tune the output of the AI to meet your specific needs.

* **Task:** The task prompt is a short description of the task you want the AI to perform. For example, you could set the task prompt to "write a blog post about the benefits of using Nuxt Kick Start".
* **Instruction:** The instruction prompt is a more detailed set of instructions for the AI. For example, you could set the instruction prompt to "write a blog post that is informative, engaging, and persuasive".
* **Context:** The context prompt is any additional information that you think would be helpful for the AI. For example, you could set the context prompt to "the target audience for the blog post is developers".

In addition to these prompts, you can also use the Nuxt Kick Start module to provide the AI with examples of the type of output you are looking for. For example, you could provide the AI with a list of blog posts that you think are well-written and informative.


### Fine-tuning

The Nuxt Kick Start module also provides a number of options for fine-tuning the output of the AI. These options allow you to control the style, tone, and length of the generated text.

* **Style:** The style option allows you to choose the style of the generated text. For example, you could choose the style to be "formal", "informal", or "creative".
* **Tone:** The tone option allows you to choose the tone of the generated text. For example, you could choose the tone to be "positive", "negative", or "neutral".
* **Length:** The length option allows you to specify the desired length of the generated text. For example, you could specify the length to be "short", "medium", or "long".

By using the prompting and fine-tuning options provided by the Nuxt Kick Start module, you can generate high-quality text that meets your specific needs.

### Examples (content)

Here are some examples of how to use the Nuxt Content component module:

- In a Markdown file, you can embed a chat component using the ::chat directive. For example, the following Markdown would render a chat component that generates content based on the page and component input.

```text
::chat
```

- You can also pass props to the chat component. For example, the following Markdown would render a chat component that generates content based on the page and component input, and also uses the task prop to specify a specific task for the AI.

```text
::chat(task="write a poem")
```

- The useChat composable can be used to generate content from the AI based on the current page. For example, the following code would generate content for the active page and return it as a Markdown formatted string.

```ts
const content = useChat();
```


### Customization

The Nuxt Content component module can be customized to meet your specific needs. For example, you can:

- Create your own custom components that extend the Chat component.
- Write your own custom composables that use the useChat composable.
- Configure the AI end-point to use a different AI model.


### Conclusion

The Nuxt Content component module is a powerful tool that can be used to generate content for your Nuxt.js applications. With its flexible API, you can easily integrate the module into your existing projects and customize it to meet your specific needs.
