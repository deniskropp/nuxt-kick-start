## Functionality of defineNuxtModule

The `defineNuxtModule` method allows users to create a plugin that can be used in a Nuxt application to extend its capabilities. Plugins can help with various features, including middleware, server-side rendering, routing, and more. By using `defineNuxtModule`, users can easily integrate and share code, accelerating development and enhancing the overall user experience.

## Steps to Create a Plugin

To create a plugin using `defineNuxtModule`, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new file with the `.js` extension, e.g., `my-module.js`.
2. Import the necessary dependencies, including `defineNuxtModule` from `'nuxt'`.
3. Create a new module using `defineNuxtModule` and provide an object with the required properties.
4. Export the module created in the previous step.

Here's an example of a basic module:

```javascript
defineNuxtModule({
  moduleName: 'myModule',
  axios: {
    baseURL: 'https://example.com',
    proxy: true,
  },
})
```

In this example, we defined a module named `myModule` that configures Axios to use a specific base URL and enable proxy settings.

To use this module in your Nuxt project, you need to add it to the `modules` section of the configuration file (`nuxt.config.js`):

```javascript
modules: [
  'my-module',
],
```
